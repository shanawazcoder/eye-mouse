# eye-mouse
Eye Mouse is a simple Python tool that lets you control your cursor using face tracking. It uses MediaPipe Face Mesh to follow nose position for movement and detects left-eye blinks to trigger clicks. Works in real time with any webcam and requires no extra hardware, making hands-free cursor control easy to test and explore.
